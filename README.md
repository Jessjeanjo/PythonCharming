# The Great Snake

A series of various Python coding projects that I have worked/ are working on as I grow into the Master Snake Charmer
I desire to one day be. 

Some of these projects are programs I write based off of my Python CS1114 Lab Course @ NYU Polytechnic SOE.
Some of the other projects are programs I write based off of Craig Kapp @ NYU's assignments.
The others are just based off of an problem from an assortment of various sites :)

These programs range in difficulty from basic projects using just a simple print function to more complex projects
which require the use of loops,and/or creating a class.

####Everyday Goal: Be a better programmer than I was yesterday
